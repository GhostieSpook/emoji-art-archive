# Haia and welcome to the `submited art/` file.
## There are 3 folders each named "Large", "Medium", and "Small".
The smaller the art = the less servers is required for the art to be created.

Smaller ones will almost always require only one Discord server to create. Please submit to the correct file.

When submiting your own be sure to create a file that includes:
1. A name that is appropriate for the emoji art. (Put [nsfw] in the name if it is nsfw please.)
2. A file with the emojis. 
3. A `.txt` file with copy a copy and pastable message to paste the emoji art. And finally 
4. An image preview of the art.

## If someone would be so willing. Could you type up a tutorial on how to submit their art below this text. Thank you!
